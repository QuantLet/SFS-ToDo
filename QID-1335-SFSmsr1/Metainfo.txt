Name of QuantLet: SFSmsr1

Published in: 'Statistics of Financial Markets : Exercises and Solutions'

Description: 'Shows the rate of convergence to infinity for the stable distributed random variables is higher than for standard normal variables. Plots the convergence rate of maximum for n random variables with a standard normal cdf and with a 1:1-stable cdf. Refers to exercise 16.2 in SFS. Requires the quantlet "stabrnd.m" for MatLab.'

Keywords: cdf, normal, random, stable, variable
